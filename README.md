We built this example for a tutorial video on our [YouTube
channel](https://charm.sh/yt) to help newcomers get started with [Bubble
Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and
[Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).

The commits for this project correspond to the milestones in the video. If
you're following along in the video and hoping to compare your code to the
solution, then definitely check out the commit history.

## About Bubble Tea

The fun, functional and stateful way to build terminal apps. A Go framework
based on [The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).
Bubble Tea is well-suited for simple and complex terminal applications, either
inline, full-window, or a mix of both.
